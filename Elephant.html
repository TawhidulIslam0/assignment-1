  <!-- Animal description -->
  <p>
  Elephants are the largest land mammals on Earth,recognized by their massive bodies, large ears, and distinctive trunks. 
  They use their trunks for breathing, grabbing food, drinking water, and even showing affection. 
  Elephants are highly intelligent and social animals, living in tight-knit family groups led by a matriarch. 
  Found in both Africa and Asia, they play a vital role in their ecosystems by shaping landscapes and spreading seeds.
  Unfortunately, elephants face serious threats from poaching and habitat destruction.
