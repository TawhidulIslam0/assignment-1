  <!-- Description -->
  <p>
    Giraffes are the tallest land animals, known for their long necks and legs, which help them reach leaves high up in acacia trees. 
    Native to Africa, they roam the savannas and woodlands in search of food and water. 
    Their unique coat patterns help them blend into the environment and differ from one giraffe to another, 
    much like human fingerprints. Giraffes live in loose social groups and are generally peaceful animals. 
    Despite their size, they can run up to 35 miles per hour when threatened.
