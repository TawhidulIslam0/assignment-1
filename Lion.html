  <!-- Descriptive paragraph about the lion -->
  <p>
    Lions are known as the kings of the jungle and are among the most powerful predators in the animal kingdom. 
    They live in groups called prides, which usually consist of related females, their cubs, and one or two males. 
    Lions primarily inhabit the savannas and grasslands of Africa, though a small population exists in India. 
    As carnivores, they hunt large prey such as zebras and wildebeest. Despite their strength and fearsome reputation, 
    lions spend most of their day resting or sleepingâ€”up to 20 hours a day.
