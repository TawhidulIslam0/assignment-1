  <!-- Animal description -->
  <p>
    Tigers are the largest species of the cat family and are easily recognized by their bold orange fur with black stripes. 
    They are solitary hunters that rely on stealth and power to capture their prey, which includes deer, wild boar, and buffalo. 
    Tigers are found primarily in Asia, including India, Russia, and parts of Southeast Asia. 
    They are excellent swimmers and often cool off in rivers and lakes. 
    Sadly, tigers are an endangered species due to habitat loss and illegal poaching.
